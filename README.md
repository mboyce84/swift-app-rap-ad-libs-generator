Ad Libs is a phrasal template word game where the user is prompted to enter words (nouns, verbs, etc), which will be substituted into a predefined story (in this case, a “rap verse”) that will be generated after clicking a button.

Initially, I started the concept where the user is responsible for entering all their own words. Later, I decided to enhance the code by creating a function (controlled by the dice button), that would randomly generate a word based on the dice pressed. Once pressed, the label for that text field is populated with a word based on an randomized value from an array of strings respective to each text field.
